# About
I am a quantitative scientist and economist with research focused on two main areas related to ecosystems (the biochemical cycles from which all organisms emerge). First, I try to improve our answers to the questions of how ecosystems work, how they are changing, and how we could tell.  Secondly, I study how human institutions and the macroeconomy govern ecosystem outcomes, and how biodiversity policy succeeds and fails in acheiving its aims

I answer these questions using a wide variety of data types and quantitative approaches, specialising in earth observation, multiomics and econometrics.

I am a former policy adviser at HM Treasury, and former conservation design lead in the Zoological Society of London's Conservation and Policy Department. I have provided expert contributions to a range of policy briefs and POSTnotes including on ["Rewilding and Ecosystem Services"](https://post.parliament.uk/research-briefings/post-pn-0537/); [making space for rewilding](https://www.rewildingeurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Making-Space-for-Rewilding-Policy-Brief1.pdf); integrating microbes into ecosystem health assessments; and [UK land use strategy](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/transform-uk-land-use-approach-for-a-sustainable-future/).

I am based at the Institute of Zoology, London. I completed my PhD at Imperial College London's Centre for Doctoral Training in Quantitative Methods in Ecology and Evolution.
