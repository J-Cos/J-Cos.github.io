# About
I am a quantitative scientist and economist studying ecosystems, the biochemical cycles from which all organisms emerge. I try to improve our answers to the questions of how ecosystems work, how they could be damaged, how we could tell, and how human institutions govern ecosystem outcomes. 

I answer these questions using a wide variety of data types and quantitative approaches, specialising in next-generation biomonitoring such as multi-omics and satellite remote sensing.

I am a former policy adviser at HM Treasury; and former conservation design lead in the Zoological Society of London's Conservation and Policy Department - where I led the technical design of sucessfully funded conservation projects worth over Â£10,000,000. I have provided expert contributions to a range of policy briefs and POSTnotes including on ["Rewilding and Ecosystem Services"](https://post.parliament.uk/research-briefings/post-pn-0537/); [making space for rewilding](https://www.rewildingeurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Making-Space-for-Rewilding-Policy-Brief1.pdf); and integrating microbes into ecosystem health assessments.

I am based at the Institute of Zoology, London. I completed my PhD at Imperial College London's Centre for Doctoral Training in Quantitative Methods in Ecology and Evolution.
