# About
I'm a scientist trying to understand how ecosystems work, how we might damage them, and how we would know.

I'm an economist seeking options to address widespread institutional failures of ecosystem governance. 

I'm a conservationist designing and evaluating new conservation strategies.

I'm a final year PhD student at Imperial College London, the Zoological Society of London and the Smithsonian Institution. Supervised by Dr Emma Ransome, Professor Nathalie Pettorelli and Dr Chris Meyer.
